  biography: "I have previous experience coding primarily in Java, but also in Matlab
    and C++, and am constantly working on broadening my knowledge in languages pertaining
    to Mobile (iOS), and Web Development.\r\n\r\nOutside of my technical skills, I
    pride myself in being a 'people-person': having held leadership positions in both
    the contexts of secondary-school and a professional working environment, I really
    enjoy understanding different people's perspectives, and leveraging their skills
    to achieve common goals.\r\n\r\nBeing Fijian/Dutch/Indian/Chinese, I also have
    an immense appreciation for diversity, and love putting effort behind causes that
    help provide opportunities to those less fortunate, both inside and outside the
    industry. I'd love to see an increase in the number of Pacific Islander Software
    Engineers!\r\n\r\nPersonal hobbies include socialising, working on personal projects,
    and slowly learning non-software languages such as French and Italian. "
