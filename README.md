Find our releases in the releases tab. This will let you see the state of the repo at the time of generating the release, and also access the binary (.apk file) for installation on your phone.

To install the APK, simply run it on your phone, and click install.

For testing reasons a cheat exists to gain large amounts of money.
To do this, in the item shop, click on the "Upgrade your Office" title text 11 times.

More documentation for each release (i.e. known bugs) are shown with each release.
